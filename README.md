# mscelns
A number of my miscellaneous functions that I find useful. Currently included:

**t_table**: Produces table of means, standard deviations, t-statistics, degrees of freedom, p-values, Cohen's ds, and confidence intervals for t-tests. It takes a list of variable names for the dependent variables.
* **mlm_ss**: Simple slope analyses for two-way interactions in two-level multilevel models.
* **ks_map**: County-level choropleth map generation for the state of Kansas.
